# What is 'Reasonable Policy' ?
"Using the [git](http://git.org) method of mass collaboration (propagation of instances and the fork / modify / merge capacity) for _POLICY DESIGN_ so that the commons crew can begin importing national environmental and financial policies from their nations and start modifying them and sharing their results with others."

The name _'Reasonable Policy'_ is chosen for a few reasons:
1. it is meant to be agreeable and considered fair and justified by the individuals it affects
2. it is meant to be as machine-understandable as possible (ie. with software reasoning systems)

# Structure
The project is organized primarily by the following levels:
1. Planet
2. Nation (2-letter country code)
3. Concern (Environment, Finance, Social, etc...; the most appropriate english Wikipedia tag)
4. Language (a translation present at least for the primary language of the nation, and any others that can be provided; 2-letter language code)

So for example, the policy for United States drinking water in English would appear in the file:

	Earth/US/Drinking_waterâ€Ž/EN/README
